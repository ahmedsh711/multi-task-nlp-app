# ðŸ§  Multi-Task NLP Classifier (Emotion â€¢ Hate Speech â€¢ Violence)

This project implements a **Multi-Task Learning (MTL)** NLP model using **LSTM** in TensorFlow/Keras.  
The model performs **three text classification tasks simultaneously**:

- **Emotion Detection**
- **Violence Detection**
- **Hate Speech Classification**

A single model shares the core layers (Embedding, LSTM, Dropout, etc.) and produces multiple outputs â€” one for each task.  
The model is deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time text prediction.
